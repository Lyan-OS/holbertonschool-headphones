## Project Overview

This project involves creating a fully functional and responsive web page from scratch, closely following a design created by Nicolas Philippot, a talented UI/UX designer, under the guidance of Guillaume Salva, CTO at Holberton School. The challenge is to replicate the design using only HTML and CSS, without the aid of external frameworks or JavaScript. The primary goal is to deliver a pixel-perfect implementation that adheres to best practices in web development, including accessibility and responsive design.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pixel-Perfect Design:** A meticulously crafted webpage that mirrors the provided design files with precision.
- **Responsive Layout:** The design seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility-Focused:** The webpage is designed with accessibility in mind, following best practices to make it usable for everyone.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes hover and active states for links and buttons to enhance user interaction.
- **Reusable Components:** Efficient use of reusable components across different sections for maintainability.

## üéØ Requirements

- **No External CSS Frameworks:** You must implement the design without using frameworks like Bootstrap.
- **No JavaScript:** All functionality and styling are achieved solely through HTML and CSS.
- **Responsive Design:** The web page must adjust to different screen sizes, switching to a mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.
- **Design Fidelity:** The final web page must look exactly like the provided Figma design file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Tasks

### 0. Familiarize with Figma

**Objective:** Understand the design details by duplicating the project in Figma and exploring all the components.

- **Figma File:** [Access the Figma Project](link-to-figma-file)
- **Fonts Required:**
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](link-to-spin-cycle-ot)
